            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <p>Despite advocating for peaceful reforms, Rizal was accused of rebellion and executed by firing squad in Bagumbayan (now Luneta Park) at the age of 35. His death solidified his status as a martyr and inspired the Philippine Revolution.</p>
