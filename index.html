                            José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda was born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna. 
                            A polymath, nationalist, and ophthalmologist, he was a key figure in the Philippine Revolution 
                            against Spanish colonial rule. He excelled in various fields including medicine, poetry, essay-writing, 
                            and linguistics, fluent in at least 22 languages.

                        Rizal's most influential works, "Noli Me Tángere" (Touch Me Not) and "El filibusterismo" 
                        (The Reign of Greed), exposed the corruption and abuses of the Spanish friars and colonial government. 
                        These novels ignited the flames of revolution among Filipinos.

                        Rizal's activism led to his arrest and trial for rebellion, sedition, and conspiracy. 
                        Despite his denial of direct involvement in violent revolution, he was found guilty and 
                        sentenced to death. He was executed by firing squad on December 30, 1896, in Bagumbayan 
                        (now Rizal Park), Manila, at the age of 35.

                        His death, however, did not quell the revolution; instead, it fueled it further, making 
                        him a martyr and an enduring symbol of Filipino nationalism. His ideals continue to 
                        inspire generations of Filipinos.
